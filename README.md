# Dibmar_rep

Hi!

Wellcome to my GitHub repository. My name is not really Dibmar, but  it has an interesting story behind it. I am a data scientist in training. This mean that I love dealing with data and have a love-hate relationship with Python. Python is simple and functional yet cruel and mysterious. As you can see, I love telling stories as well.

On a more serious note, the repository you are just now surveying (Dibmar_rep) is home to a varied sort of Data Science related code:
Firstly those exercises that are deemed worthy of being uploaded will be on the folder “exercises”. It is my firm believe that learning is a process and it is only fair that you get a sneak peak at such.

Secondly, my Data Science projects. As I have stated, I love breaking up data and see what the whole story behind it. Since I am writing this well ahead of time, the contents of the “projects” folder are still either in development or to come. Nonetheless this folder will be used to store the code, while the similarly named “project_logs” keeps a detailed record of my progress.

Lastly, I leave here my business related e-mail address (diomedes.barbero@gmail.com) In any case, I do hope that you enjoy visiting my profile.


Cheers!
Dibmar
