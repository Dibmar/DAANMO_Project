DAANMO Project log

DAANMO is a EDA project centered around movies. The main goal of DAANMO is to analyze the Movies Dataframe (source: https://bit.ly/2Jc6BV2) in order to bring light into the data contained in it and draw the subsequent conclusions.
DAANMO consists of six (6) dataframes, which in turn contain more than 4500 different movies of various genres and release dates (up to 2017):
    - Credits: full cast and crew
    - Links and Links Small: original source of data and movie id
    - Keywords: genre related keywords for pitch
    - Ratings and Ratings small: ratings from original source, up to 5 stars.


Definitions
    The following definitions have been provided to better understand the terms used in the present document and files.
        - Genres: a collection of asociations (mainly narrative and iconographic) that allows the inmediate identification of the themes of the movie.
        - Subgenres: the combination of two or more genres
        - Cast: part of the creative team. Composed by actors with lines.
        - Crew: creative team. Responsible for the creation of the movie. In this document and files, refers to every other individual involved in the production of a movie.
            * Director: The person responsible for coordinating the creative team in the shooting of the script.
            * Producer: The person responsible for financing, budgeting and coordinating with both the creative team and financial partners.
            * Wirter: The person credited for writing the movie's script.
        - Script: a formated tecnical document which allows the shooting of a motion picture, whith necessary descriptions for characters, scenes... etc.

    + Actions taken
        - DAANMO Project Log created
        - Credits, Links (and Links Small), Ratings, and Movies Metadata csv files explored
            * Movies Metadata contains revenue information. Useful for calculating profitability
    + Random encounters
        - Credits
            * Need to convert lists contained in cells as df columns
        - Ratings
            * Need to convert timestamp into regular date object
        - Links and Links Small
            * NaN data encountered. SOLVED: Set to 0 as default for data conversion. 
        -Movies Metadata
            * NaN values encountered in IMDB Id column. Probably related to Links and Links Small problem. Identification of this titles (17/45000) may prove impossible
            * Various NaN values in all other columns except columns: adult, budget, genres, id and original title. Though worrying, none of these NaN values appear in large numbers in key columns.
            * Similar column issue as in -Credits-

            * revenue 
            * popularity
        - Creation of a df (benefits) referent to movie_metadata. It shows the benefits achieved by the movie in question. It contains data about 17% (aprox) of the total sum of movies (see Random encounters)
        - Creation of a df (popularity_df) referent to movie_metadata. It shows the popularity coeficient. Currently in float format.
        - All kernels in Kaggle are now public

        - The columns of "languages" and "production countries" columns
            * Revealing a large predominance and importance of the english speaking market, specifically the US'
    + Random encounters
        - Kaggle and pyplots does not seem to work in the same way

        - Kaggle does not display the graphs it produces.

03/04/2020
    + Actions taken
        - New jupyter notebook created (cross-indexing). It's aim is to serve as a location for the presentation of the results that need to be expressed by using multiple csvs
        - New jupyter notebook created (keywords). This is the last csv in need of exploratory work
            * Contains information relevant to the pitch / marketing of the movie: useful for recommendation generator.
        - Continuing wiht movie_metadata research.
        - All code to date uploaded to GitHub. Kaggle will be updated when the project is complete, as per recommendation.
    
    + Random encounters
        - The credits/cast cells are still a problem: translation from a pd series to a json and then again to pd is necessary. Unfortunately, pd series objects cannot be expressed that way apparently
        - Keywords suffers from the same issues as expressed above

08/04/2020
    + Actions taken
        - credits and keywords csvs are now being explored using the literal_eval method
        - "budget" df is now called "profit". "money_earned" column is now called "profit"
        - movie_metadata exploration continues:
            * Better representation of genres by usage of list separation methods
            * Combination of "profit" and "genres" in "profit_gen". A top 10 most profitable genres and subgeneres have been plotted.

    + Actions taken
        - cast explored:
            * gender distribution seems to indicate a predominance of male actors, though some margin of error must be taken into account.
    
    + Random encounters
        - credits:
            * need to establish a categorization of billing for actors in the credits. Info has been requested.

        - crew df is being explored
            * Cleaning process 2/3 done
            * Director, Producer and Wirter roles selected for analysis.

    + Random encounters
        - crew df
            * Numerous instances of empty cells in producers and writers columns. That should not be. Nonetheless has no feasable fix. And therefore shoud be ignored in the future.

15/04/2020
    + Actions taken
        - crew df cleaned and explored
            * A high number of NaNs in the directos and producers columns have been observed. The backwards-fillna method has been utilized.
            * Nonetheless, the disparity of gender ratios within the most important roles in movie production has been noted: female personnel is by far the less numerous.
                Further studies of this trend may help the visualization of sexual harrasment in the movie industry
    + Random encounters
        - High number of NaNs in crew df refering to directors and producers columns.

16/04/2020
    + Actions taken
        - New notebook created (fixer-names) in order to fix the gender issue in actors and crew dfs (See above)
            * New specific function created for that pourpose
            * New df (dfnu) created for that pourpose
        - gender_search function added to EDA library (black_library)

21/04/2020
    + Actions taken
        - Cleaning process of the actors', producers' and directors' dfs continues.
            * NaN names seem to point to a foreing (non english-speaking origin)
                The following courses of action can be pursued:
                    - Maintain the cleaning process
                        With a more expansive data base of names and a faster assigment function
                    - Forgoe the process and work only with english-based data
                
                For the moment the first course of action will be pursued.
        - dfnu df cleaning process has ended.

    + Random encounters
        - genres csv
            * NaN values detected thanks to genres_unique creation. Despite their presece, their impact is minimal. Therefore, no further effort
